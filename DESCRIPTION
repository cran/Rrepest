Description: An easy way to analyze international large-scale assessments and surveys in education or any other dataset that includes replicated weights (Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR) weights, Jackknife replicate weights,...) while also allowing for analysis with multiply imputed variables (plausible values). It supports the estimation of univariate statistics (e.g. mean, variance, standard deviation, quantiles), frequencies, correlation, linear regression and any other model already implemented in R that takes a data frame and weights as parameters. It also includes  options to prepare the results for publication, following the table formatting standards of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
